## Setup

For this example, I'm going to use Chromedriver with Selenium.

1. Download Chromedriver.
 * Make sure to download the correct version that works with your OS here: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/
1. Install Chromedriver in your `PATH` so Python may use the browser.
1. Edit your change_log.txt file with your updates.
